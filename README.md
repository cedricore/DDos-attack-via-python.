# Attack DDos Via Python
> This DDoS attack uses the requests library. It works through GET requests. The number of requests is determined by the user, that is, you. This is my first project. Please let me know if you encounter any errors or are dissatisfied!
## Description
A DDoS attack makes multiple requests per second to a website, which can cause the site to become overloaded and go offline. It's important to remember that I'm not responsible for your use of my tool. As the creator, use it responsibly and at your own discretion. I created it for my first Github project! It works through Python's **requests** library, which allows for requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE). Using the GET function, a **DDoS** attack is entirely possible.
